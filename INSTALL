= INSTALLATION =

== PREPARE ==

Figure out one of the include paths in your PHP installation.

You can do that with the following command:
 php -i |grep include_path

Most likely one of /usr/share/php or /usr/lib/php will be suitable.


== INSTALL ==

Then copy the "DF.php" file and the "DF" directory from this package into
one of the directories on the PHP include path.

 $ sudo cp -R DF DF.php /usr/share/php/


== DEPENDENCIES ==

This library depends on some other PHP libraries.
Some of them can be find in your OS distribution package repository,
others in PHP PEAR and some you might download and install manually.

 - Smarty
 - Spyc
 - log4php
 - simpletest (for running the tests)
 - File
 - Log
 - Cache_Lite

Not all packages are required at all time,
for example for logging only log4php or Log is required.


== RUNNING TESTS ==

Before using this library you should make sure all tests in the
"tests" directory runs without any failures.

Run the tests with this command:
