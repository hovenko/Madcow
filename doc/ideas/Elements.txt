Database and elements persist

When storing elements we need to run the update or insert routines in a transaction.
All update and insert statements in the database needs to run in the same transaction.

Maybe the elements should have only one method to update the database data:
 persist()

Calling persist() on an elements should:
 start the transaction
 prepare all data for storage; relations, entity partials
 passing on the element to the database
 the database calls on the element to update or insert the elements data, with a reference to itself

The persist() method needs to be separated from the normal update and insert methods of the element.
