== Current state ==

Currently only YAML configuration files are supported.


== YAML ==

For the syntax of YAML files, see elsewhere... or see the examples.

As a short and quick intro:
 - no tabs are allowed, only spaces
 - I recommend four spaces for every indentation
 - key/value mapping separated with colon (:)
 - list items is prepended with a hyphen (-)
